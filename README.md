# Compacting

An intelligent compact chat mod for Fabric, largely inspired by the logic of same feature from [Patcher].

Messages are compacted based on how long ago they were last seen, instead of only by comparing by the
last few chat messages.

// TODO BEFORE AFTER

It also intelligently handles dividers:

// TODO IMAGE

## Known Issues

- Any mod that adds timestamps in any capacity will very likely break chat compacting.
